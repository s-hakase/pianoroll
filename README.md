# Vue.js Piano roll editor

It is a piano role editor application that I am making as an exercise of application creation using Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
